"Tolkäppiyam, the great Tamil Grammar is a monumental work and it is not easy to describe in a few words its place in any scheme for Tamil Studies. ""Its importance for the study of Tamil culture and of cultures in general cannot be exagge rated."" In three parts it deals with Phonology, Morphology Syntax and Theory of Literature. There are discussions and disputations about its age. With the help of internal evidence scholars place it between 1000 B. C. and 600 В. С.",,சிறப்புப் பாயிரம்,

"The historian tells us that at the end of the period of the third Tamil Academy proper attention was not given to the study of Tolkäppiyam¹ and this was due to political, sociological and economic conditions. Probably the commentators of this great Grammar saw this plight and their efforts brought in a revival of the study of Tolkäppiyam. Time has come to study this great work in the light of modern linguistic findings. Any great attempt like Tolkäppiyam certainly employs a whole set of contemporary systems to bear on what one does. Its methods of application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation are very much influenced by the mathe. matical and logical methods of the day. If one looks at Tol- käppiyam in the light of the different systems from Ferdinand de Saussure through Louis Hjelmslev, Bloomfield, K.L. Pike, Linguists of the Prague School, J.R. Firth to Chomsky one finds astonishingly startling facts about the basic methodology this great Grammarian has used in the theory of language and literature and research. A most interesting study would come out if scholars try to find out how for the consciousness of these various schools are found in Tolkäppiyam. As this is not the place to attempt such a stupendous task I shall discuss briefly what is absolutely necessary in this line of research for the English reader who is going to use this translation.",An Approach to Tolkapplyam,,
